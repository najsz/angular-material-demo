# ngrx-demo
Demo application for ngrx, also containing assignments

# Prequisites
* Recent NodeJS installation
* Decent amount of Angular knowledge (terminology)

# Getting started
1. Checkout the project with `git clone https://github.com/rstraub/ngrx-demo.git`
2. After checkout change directory to the folder
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies
4. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to run the project
5. In your browser go to `http://localhost:4200/` the application should be running there

# Future work
The application right now is not coded as nicely as I would like to see it by time constraints.
I would like to structure it even better, highlighting that it is possible to make an ngrx application really nice and maintainable.
